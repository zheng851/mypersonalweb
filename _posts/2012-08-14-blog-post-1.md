This is something I did years ago for my SSWR presentation. Bascially, I wanted to creat a map to show the location of the universities that were hiring social work faculty. One way I could do was to find a US map and put the dots myself. But I am lazy, so I tried to do this in R. And it was super easy to do. 

## Preparation 
Here are the packages that you will need.

    library(ggplot2)
    library(usmap)
    library()
    library(fiftystater)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggmap)
    library(state.region)
    library(dplyr)

If you don't have the packages, use `install.packages("nameofthepackage")` to install the package (e.g. `install.packages('ggplot2')`. Some of you may have a hard time installing the package "fiftystater", you can use this line of code: `devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")`


    




You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
