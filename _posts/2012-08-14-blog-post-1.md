This is something I did years ago for my SSWR presentation. Bascially, I wanted to creat a map to show the location of the universities that were hiring social work faculty. One way I could do was to find a US map and put the dots on the map myself. But I am lazy, so I tried to do this in R. And it was super easy to do. 

## Preparation 
Here are the packages that you will need.

    library(ggplot2)
    library(usmap)
    library(fiftystater)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(ggmap)
    library(state.region)
    library(dplyr)

Note: If you don't have the packages, use `install.packages("nameofthepackage")` to install the package (e.g. `install.packages('ggplot2')`. Some of you may have a hard time installing the package "fiftystater", you can use this line of code: `devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")`

Let's say I want map the top 100 public high school in the United State. [Download the dataset here](zhmy89.github.io/mypersonalweb/files/hs.csv)

    hs <- read.csv("hs.csv") # load the dataset
    head(hs) # display the first 6 rows of the dataset
    
 |ID|Rank|Enrollment|School|Location|
 | ---| ------ | -- | -- | -- |
|1|1|14,153|Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow|Columbus, OH|
|2|2|13,916|Georgia Cyber Academy|Atlanta, GA|
|3|3|11,372|Noble Street Charter Schools|Chicago, IL|
|4|4|9,466|Ohio Virtual Academy|Maumee, OH|
|5|5|9,058|Pennsylvania Cyber Cs|Midland, PA|
|6|6|8,877|Commonwealth Connections Academy Cs|Harrisburg, PA|
    
    
## Generating latitude and longitude

As you can see, I only have the name of the schools in the dataset. I will need their latitudes and longitudes to pinpoint them on the map. Of course, I don't want to enter each latitude and longitude manually. Again, I am lazy. So I will use the pacage, ggmap (author: David Kahle david.kahle@gmail.com). 

    hs$School <- as.character.factor(hs$School) 
    # Need to change the name of the schools to "character" so that ggmap can read.
    
    hs_geo <- mutate_geocode(hs,School, source = "google") 
    # The line of code wiill create a new dataset that incldues the latitude and longitude for each school 
    # hs is the dataset, School is the name of the schoools.
    
NOTE: Please note that 

 |ID|Rank|Enrollment|School|Location|lon|lat|
 | ---| ------ | -- | -- | -- |-- | -- |
|1 | 1|   14,153|    Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow|   Columbus, OH| -82.99854 |39.88650|
|  2|    2 |    13,916|               Georgia Cyber Academy|    Atlanta, GA| -84.44624| 33.61567|
| 3 |   3  |   11,372 |       Noble Street Charter Schools |   Chicago, IL| -87.62725| 41.88241|
| 4  |  4   |   9,466  |              Ohio Virtual Academy |   Maumee, OH| -83.68418| 41.58705|
| 5   | 5    |  9,058   |            Pennsylvania Cyber Cs  |Midland, PA | -80.45475| 40.63853|
| 6    |6     | 8,877 |Commonwealth Connections Academy Cs |Harrisburg, PA| -76.88340| 40.29274 |   
    
    
    
    ggplot() 
    + geom_polygon(data=fifty_states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group),color="white", fill="grey92" )
    # this help me to draw a US map. 
    + geom_point(data=locations_df, aes(x=lon, y=lat), size = 1)
    # this help me to pinpoint the location of the schools based on the latitude and longitude.
    # size means the size of the points. We can change it to size =2 or larger numbers.
